McDistance in Android
---------------------

What is a McDistance?

The McDistance is a dynamic measurement unit. It measures the distance between you and the nearest McDonald's. You are always 1 McDistance from the nearest McDonald's or you are at McDonald's (meaning your McDistance is 0).

What does this mean?

Two people in two different locations can both have a McDistance of 1. However, the distance between one person and McDonald's may be far greater than the other person's distance from McDonald's. This can lead to some confusion. This application was created to help solve this problem.

What does this app do?

This app will calculate your McDistance and even provide handy conversions to the units of your choice (such as miles or kilometers). You can use a map to calculate how many McDistances it is to the location of your choice, and you can get directions to the nearest McDonald's.
